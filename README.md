# Fokus - To Do app tailored specifically for students

Ever been assigned a task/assignment but completely forgot it and its details? If you're lazy as me, that didn't take notes every single class, you can put your assignments/tasks here and be notified based on your preferences. You can also attach some files to help you finish your tasks and tag it with a course subject.
